Text-Rain
=========

Animation of rain, where droplets are letters and interact with the user via camera. This project was inspired by Camile Utterback's Text Rain Exhibit (http://camilleutterback.com/projects/text-rain/) and was originally created for Golan Levin's Interactive Art and Computation Design Class.

Basic Interaction
-----------------

Basic interaction requires the user to stand in front of a light (preferably white background). Rain will start falling from the top of the screen. The user will be thresholded, and droplets that collide with the user will stop and move according to the obstacle.
